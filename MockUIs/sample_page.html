      <h1>Page name</h1> 
      <p>Some information about the page you are currently on. Most if not all pages should have one of these. This is just a sample page to coordinate how we style our pages.

This is not an inflexible restriction, but your Mock UIs should be such that this page does not look out of place in comparison to your page. Go to sample_2</p>
